# The-amazing-phonebook

Managing a large number of contacts manually is cumbersome. Lack of needed feature and easy search
option makes it harder to maintain those contacts. In this project I’ve made a console application that will
help to solve these problems. This Phone Book Project is to display detailed phone information like
user’s favorite cell phone. It is similar to the contact manager in a cell phones. In this project, you can
add, delete, and update contacts easily. You can all call and there is a call log list. There is also speed dial
option which makes it easier to call any particular contact with a single key.

# Header Files:
#include <stdio.h> - for standard input/output.
#include <string.h> - for string operations.
#include <stdlib.h> - for memory allocation functions.
#include <windows.h> - for manipulation the window.

# Main variables:
speedid of type int <br>
choice of type int <br>
name of type string <br>
phone of type string <br>
email of type string <br>

# Algorithm:
Step 1: Start <br>
Step 2: Show the menu. <br>
Step 3: <br>
if 1: Show contacts list. <br>
if 2: Call. <br>
step 1: call by name. <br>
step 2: show list. <br>
if 3: Show call log. <br>
if 4: Speed dial. <br>
step 1: call from speed dial. <br>
step 2: add number to speed dial. <br>
if 5: Add a new contact <br>
if 6: Update contact. <br>
if 7: Delete contact. <br>
if 8: Exit. <br>

# Challenges faced:
The main challenge if faced is to give specific index into linked list and find number through linked list.
I’ve overcome this challenge by using a for loop and a specific function to give indices to nodes.
Another problem I faced was to implement the speed dial option. It was hard to associate a number to a
specific node. I’ve used a global variable and an array to solve this problem.
Too many variables made the made the code hard to read so I’ve used the concept of modular
programming and divided the program into separate functions and commented each line.

# Conclusion:
This program if implemented in feature cell phones will improve the productivity of people radically. My
future plan is to add favorites, call timer and a nice GUI based user interface to ease and to make calling
much easier.

# Learning Outcome:
1. Gained thorough knowledge on linked list.
2. Learned how to implement stack using linked list.
3. Learned about module programming.
4. Learned how to manipulate string and use them in functions.
5. Learned about pointers use in function.
6. Learn how to make a complete application software.
